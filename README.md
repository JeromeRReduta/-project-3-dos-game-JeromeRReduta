        fixed a bug where for loop ran 2 iterations w/o stopping
        Basically, if you don't put scan.nextLine() after scan.nextAnything()
        (except for scan.nextLine()), scan.nextLine() will automatically
        pick up the end of the last line as its input
        Putting scan.nextLine() fixes that problem
