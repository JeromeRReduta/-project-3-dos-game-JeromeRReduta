Goal: Make ruleset for DOS

Setup
1) Each player draws 7 cards
2) (Computer will deal cards)
3) 2 cards from deck put face up in center row

Play
1) Number Match - Match #s w/ 1 or both cards to card in Center Row
2) Otherwise, draw
3) Keep repeating until you get a match

Number Match
1) Can play:
    1 card that matches # of a card in Center Row
    2 cards whose sum matches # of a card in Center Row

2) Can number match EACH CARD in Center Row up to once per turn

(Must match #s, color alone isn't enough)

Number & Color Match

1) Single color-match - if card matches # and color, may (don't
    have to) put card from hand face-up in Center Row
    (increases Center Row size by 1)

2) Dbl color match - if both cards have sum that match #
    and each card matches color of card in Center Row, may
    put card from hand face-up in Center Row (increases Center Row
    size by 1) AND all players must draw 1 card


Draw

1) If you can't or don't want to make a match, draw a card
2) After, make a match if you can
3) Otherwise, put one card from hand face up in center row

Ending Your Turn
1) Take all stacks of cards in Center Row w/ 2+ cards on them,
    and put them into discard pile

2) If < 2 cards in Center Row, refill it w/ cards from deck until
    2 cards in center Row

3) Put one card from hand face up in Center Row fro each Color
    Match Bonus you earned


Special Cards
1) Wild DOS Card - value 2, you decide what color when you play it
2) Wild # card - give color, decide its # when you play it

DOS Rule (I'm not sure if I even want to implement this yet)
1) If you have 2 cards in hand, must shout "DOS" (translate this
    into smth later idk)
2) If someone else calls "DOS" before you, you must draw 2 cards
3) If it is your turn, draw the cards @ end of turn
4) Otherwise, draw them immediately


Ending the Round
1) Whoever has no cards in hand @ end of turn wins
