DOS Rules - It. 2

Setup
1) Each player draws 7 cards - going around for each card
    e.g. player 1 draws 1 card, player 2 draws 1 card, player 3
    draws 1 card, player 1 draws 2nd card, etc.

2) 2 cards from deck put face up in center row

Play
1) NUMBER MATCH - Match 1-2 cards whose sum is = to # on Center Row
2) Otherwise, DRAW

Number Match
1) Match 1-2 cards in hand whose sum = to # on Center Row
2) Can make match for EACH CARD in Center Row up to once each/turn

Number & Color Match
1) If all cards match in color, may put card from hadn face-up
    in Center Row

2) If color match w/ 2 cards from hand, all other players must
    also draw 1 card

Draw

    to center row

Ending Your Turn

    Match Bonus you earned

Special Cards
1) Wild DOS Card - value = 2, color decided on play
2) Wild # Card - color given, value decided on play

DOS Rule (should I implement this?)
1) If you have 2 cards in your hand, shout out "DOS!"
2) If someone besides player says "DOS!" first, player draws 2 cards
3) If it is player's turn, they draw it @ end of card
4) Otherwise, they draw immediately

Ending the Round
1) If player has no cards in hand, they win
2) SPECIAL RULE FOR THIS PROJECT: If player has >= 5 bonus pts,
    they win
